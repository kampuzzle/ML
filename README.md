# ML - TOP WORDS IN A SUBREDDIT

This is a simple algorithm that receives a N number and shows the N most common words in the Coldplay subreddit. It generates a json with the N words and their frequencies in the subreddit, a pie graph showing the percentage of each of the words and a wordcloud of all the words in the subreddit.  

### Execution

To run the code you have to navigate to 'Projeto-1' folder and run "docker-compose up" in the terminal.
After that you'll access the browser linked to the container that navigates you to jupyterlab, where you can test the code as you wish. You can also access the notebook file by entering the "ml-training" folder.
